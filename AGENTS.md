# node-monorepo

## Overview

A pnpm monorepo of technology-specific starter templates (React, Next.js, Chrome extension, CDK, API). Each workspace under `apps/` is a runnable, self-contained starter for a different stack, and `packages/` holds libraries, starting with the `_workspace` scaffold. The repo uses `@williamthorsen/nmr` as its unified workspace script runner, `@williamthorsen/release-kit` for releases, and `readyup` for pre-release checks.

## Project structure

- `apps/api` — Node.js API run from its `.ts` sources under Node's type stripping
- `apps/cdk` — AWS CDK infrastructure
- `apps/chrome` — Chrome extension (Vite, ESM + IIFE builds)
- `apps/nextjs` — Next.js app with Tailwind CSS
- `apps/react` — React app (Vite)
- `packages/_workspace` — scaffold for new libraries (no-op build)
- `.config/release-kit.config.ts` — release-kit configuration
- `.config/readyup.config.ts` — readyup configuration
- `.config/wt.toml` — worktrunk hooks, whose `[pre-start]` pipeline copies gitignored local files into a new worktree before installing dependencies
- `.worktreeinclude` — the allowlist bounding that copy; without it every gitignored file is copied
- `.readyup/kits/` — readyup check kits (template drift detection)
- `docs/migrations/` — migration guides linked from drift-kit fix messages
- `docs/new-package.md` — checklist for starting an app or a library from a template and giving the copy its own identity

The drift kit checks only conventions that no package's own kit owns. A convention belonging to `@williamthorsen/nmr` or another first-party package is checked by that package's kit, so the kit that owns a convention is the one that reports on it.

The fleet drift sweep runs this kit and `williamthorsen/.github`'s kit, which checks the callers of that repo's reusable code-quality workflow: a consumer calls the workflow but never installs it, so no package kit can reach it. A convention delegated to a package's kit goes unreported in a fleet repo unless that repo runs `rdy run --sources` itself, so two shapes of check stay here: a floor check, reporting a delegated package absent or too old to publish its kit; and a completeness check, reporting one that is installed but missing from `.config/readyup.config.ts`, where `rdy run --sources` never reaches it.

A floor check names the version that first publishes the delegated check and is fixed there, never raised to track the package's current release. Raising it turns an anchor into a second live floor, which is how the kit's former `@williamthorsen/strict-lint` floor came to sit one major below the one nmr asserts.

## Commands

Invoking nmr belongs to `@williamthorsen/nmr`. Its ambient rulebook carries the `nmr`-not-`pnpm run` rule, the cwd scoping, the `ci`/`prepush` split, and the check-result cache, and bare `nmr` prints every command with its expansion and every flag, so this section restates none of it.

`nmr drift:sweep` runs the drift kit and `williamthorsen/.github`'s kit across every repo whose stack in the machine's registry contains `nmr`, read through `thor-repo list` (`--json` for machine-readable output; `--manifest <path>` sweeps from a file instead).

`.github/workflows/code-quality.yaml` runs six parallel legs: `build`, `lint`, `static`, `test`, and `workflows`, which together run the constituents of `nmr ci`, and `shell`, which runs `nmr lint:shell` (`shellcheck` over every tracked `*.sh` file). It is the only workflow that runs an nmr command. The dependency audit runs from `.github/workflows/audit.yaml` on every pull request to `main` or `next` and on a daily schedule, through a reusable workflow rather than through `nmr audit`.

Readyup kits are run by hand, never from CI: `pnpm exec rdy run` runs this repo's own drift kit, and `pnpm exec rdy run --sources` runs the kits published by the sources that `.config/readyup.config.ts` lists. Run the second after a dependency upgrade — that is what makes a convention delegated to a package's kit a relocation rather than a deletion.

Scripts not in the `nmr` registry — per-package scripts such as `dev`, `preview`, and `start` — are run with `pnpm run <script>`. Run binaries with `pnpm exec <binary>`.

## Architecture

### nmr workspace script system

`@williamthorsen/nmr` provides a unified CLI (`nmr`) with predefined workspace and root commands. Composite commands (like `check`) expand into sequences of sub-commands.

### Build system

Neither `api` nor `cdk` compiles its TypeScript: Node runs their `.ts` sources directly by stripping types. Each keeps to the syntax that stripping can run through `erasableSyntaxOnly` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` in its tsconfig, so the typecheck rejects an `enum` or a value import of a type before Node does.

A package that publishes a library compiles instead, via `nmr compile`, which runs the `nmr-compile` bin from `@williamthorsen/nmr`. It uses the TypeScript compiler API to emit a package's `src` to `dist/esm` as `.js` and `.d.ts` in one pass, rewriting relative `.ts` → `.js` specifiers and tsconfig `paths` aliases in both outputs, and skipping work when inputs are unchanged. There is no repo-local build script to maintain; build fixes arrive via an `@williamthorsen/nmr` version bump.

Framework packages (React, Next.js, Chrome) use their own build tools (Vite, Next.js).

### Testing

Vitest, configured through the factories in `@williamthorsen/nmr/vitest`, which give every config the same four tier projects.

The test-tier convention belongs to `@williamthorsen/nmr`. Its ambient rulebook states where a test file lives, how it is named, and which tier it runs under, and `node_modules/@williamthorsen/nmr/README.md` carries the rest, so this section restates none of it.

This repo declares nmr's conventions check in `__tests__/test-file-conventions.app.unit.test.ts`, so a test file outside `__tests__/`, or one whose tier segment is missing or misspelt, fails the test run.

Five configs exist:

- `vitest.config.ts` uses the package factory, so it sets no root and no workspace exclusions. It backs root `test:watch`, which sweeps the whole repo, and it is the config that `nmr-vitest` passes to a package carrying no config of its own. Do not "correct" it to the root factory. The sweep applies neither happy-dom nor the React packages' setup files, so root `test:watch` fails their suites; run `nmr test:watch` from inside `apps/react` or `apps/nextjs` instead.
- `vitest.root.config.ts` uses the root factory, which excludes every workspace that `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares. Only `nmr root:test*` reaches it, by explicit `--config`.
- `apps/{nextjs,react}/vitest.config.ts` hold customization with no repo-wide expression: a happy-dom environment that the Node packages must not inherit.
- `apps/chrome/vitest.config.ts` adds nothing and still cannot be deleted. `nmr-vitest` passes the shared config only to a package that holds neither a `vitest.config.*` nor a `vite.config.*`, so a package holding a `vite.config.ts` never reaches the shared configuration. Its presence, not its content, is what wins config resolution.

A package needs its own config when it customizes the shared one **or** when it carries a `vite.config.ts`. Deleting a config that "only calls the factory" is safe only in a package with no Vite config of its own; elsewhere it drops the projects model, and every tier-selecting command then fails with `No projects matched the filter` — a test-count check does not catch it.

### Dependencies

Every package declares every module it imports; nothing is inherited from the root. The root `package.json` carries no `workspaces` field, and its absence is deliberate: `eslint-plugin-n` reads that field to union the root's dependency names into each package's before evaluating `n/no-extraneous-import`, so restoring it would silently return the repo to inheriting. pnpm reads `pnpm-workspace.yaml` instead, as do `readyup` and `nmr`, so nothing else depends on it. A missing declaration is reported by `nmr lint:check`, and the fix is to declare the dependency, never to suppress the rule.

A dependency that two or more manifests declare is versioned once, in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `catalog:` block, and each manifest names it as `"catalog:"`. Anything declared by a single manifest keeps a literal version there. `savePrefix: ''` pins exact versions either way.

### Intra-package imports

A package reaches its own source through the subpath import `#src/*`, which maps to `./src/*`. The package declares it in the `imports` field of its `package.json`, which Node, TypeScript, Vite, and ESLint resolve without further configuration. A compiled library declares it in tsconfig `paths` instead, because `nmr-compile` rewrites those to relative specifiers on emit. A package never declares it in both places: TypeScript consults `paths` before `imports`, and a second declaration can drift from the first without any error.

An import of a file under `src/` never climbs with `..`. It is relative when its target is in the importing file's directory or below, and uses `#src/` otherwise. A test file is the one exception: It reaches the directory beside its `__tests__/` with a single `..`. A file outside `src/`, such as `package.json`, is outside the alias's reach and is imported relatively. An aliased specifier keeps its `.ts` extension, as a relative one does, and `import-x/extensions` reports one that omits it.

Every package declares the alias, `_workspace` included, so that a package copied from a template starts with it. `api` and `cdk` run under Node, which resolves `#src/` from `package.json` directly.

### Git hooks

Lefthook formats staged files with `nmr fmt` in the pre-commit hook, and re-stages what it rewrites. `nmr fmt` is what the hook runs rather than Prettier directly, so the hook and `nmr fmt:check` select the same files: both honor every `.prettierignore` in the tree, where a Prettier invocation from the repo root reads only the root one.

### TypeScript

Uses `tsgo` (TypeScript native preview) for type checking.

The language level and strictness set come from `@williamthorsen/tsconfig`, which the root `tsconfig.json` extends: `@tsconfig/strictest` plus the Node options it omits, at NodeNext/ES2025. The root adds only `resolveJsonModule` and turns off `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`, under which the typecheck rejects the `.ts` extension on a `#src/` specifier; no package here emits with `tsc`, and `nmr-compile` turns the flag on for its own emit. A package declares only what is genuinely its own. Do not restate the base's flags here or in a package config — a second copy is what drifts.

`lib` replaces rather than extends, so a package needing DOM types repeats the ES year alongside them.

## Code style

- Never use `any`, type assertions, or non-null assertions.
