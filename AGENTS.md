## Overview

Work items as sized bubbles on urgency and importance axes, with adapters for GitHub and Jira. A pnpm monorepo: `apps/` holds runnable apps and `packages/` holds libraries, starting with the `_workspace` scaffold. The repo uses `@williamthorsen/nmr` as its unified workspace script runner, `@williamthorsen/release-kit` for releases, and `readyup` for pre-release checks. [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) records the product's purpose, its decisions with their reasons, and its rough package structure.

## Project structure

- `packages/_workspace` — scaffold for new libraries (no-op build)
- `.config/release-kit.config.ts` — release-kit configuration
- `.config/readyup.config.ts` — readyup configuration
- `.config/wt.toml` — worktrunk hooks, whose `[pre-start]` pipeline copies gitignored local files into a new worktree before installing dependencies
- `.worktreeinclude` — the allowlist bounding that copy; without it every gitignored file is copied
- `docs/design.md` — the product's design doc
- `docs/new-package.md` — checklist for starting an app or a library from the `_workspace` scaffold and giving the copy its own identity

## Commands

Invoking nmr belongs to `@williamthorsen/nmr`. Its ambient rulebook carries the `nmr`-not-`pnpm run` rule, the cwd scoping, the `ci`/`prepush` split, and the check-result cache, and bare `nmr` prints every command with its expansion and every flag, so this section restates none of it.

`.github/workflows/code-quality.yaml` runs six parallel legs: `build`, `lint`, `static`, `test`, and `workflows`, which together run the constituents of `nmr ci`, and `shell`, which runs `nmr lint:shell` (`shellcheck` over every tracked `*.sh` file). It is the only workflow that runs an nmr command. The dependency audit runs from `.github/workflows/audit.yaml` on every pull request to `main` or `next` and on a daily schedule, through a reusable workflow rather than through `nmr audit`.

Readyup kits are run by hand, never from CI: `pnpm exec rdy run --sources` runs the kits published by the sources that `.config/readyup.config.ts` lists. Run it after a dependency upgrade, so that a convention checked by a package's kit is still checked.

Scripts not in the `nmr` registry — per-package scripts such as `dev`, `preview`, and `start` — are run with `pnpm run <script>`. Run binaries with `pnpm exec <binary>`.

## Architecture

### nmr workspace script system

`@williamthorsen/nmr` provides a unified CLI (`nmr`) with predefined workspace and root commands. Composite commands (like `check`) expand into sequences of sub-commands.

### Build system

A package that publishes a library compiles instead, via `nmr compile`, which runs the `nmr-compile` bin from `@williamthorsen/nmr`. It uses the TypeScript compiler API to emit a package's `src` to `dist/esm` as `.js` and `.d.ts` in one pass, rewriting relative `.ts` → `.js` specifiers and tsconfig `paths` aliases in both outputs, and skipping work when inputs are unchanged. There is no repo-local build script to maintain; build fixes arrive via an `@williamthorsen/nmr` version bump.

### Testing

Vitest, configured through the factories in `@williamthorsen/nmr/vitest`, which give every config the same four tier projects.

The test-tier convention belongs to `@williamthorsen/nmr`. Its ambient rulebook states where a test file lives, how it is named, and which tier it runs under, and `node_modules/@williamthorsen/nmr/README.md` carries the rest, so this section restates none of it.

This repo declares nmr's conventions check in `__tests__/test-file-conventions.app.unit.test.ts`, so a test file outside `__tests__/`, or one whose tier segment is missing or misspelt, fails the test run.

Two configs exist:

- `vitest.config.ts` uses the package factory, so it sets no root and no workspace exclusions. It backs root `test:watch`, which sweeps the whole repo, and it is the config that `nmr-vitest` passes to a package carrying no config of its own. Do not "correct" it to the root factory.
- `vitest.root.config.ts` uses the root factory, which excludes every workspace that `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares. Only `nmr root:test*` reaches it, by explicit `--config`.

A package needs its own config when it customizes the shared one **or** when it carries a `vite.config.ts`. Deleting a config that "only calls the factory" is safe only in a package with no Vite config of its own; elsewhere it drops the projects model, and every tier-selecting command then fails with `No projects matched the filter` — a test-count check does not catch it.

### Dependencies

Every package declares every module it imports; nothing is inherited from the root. The root `package.json` carries no `workspaces` field, and its absence is deliberate: `eslint-plugin-n` reads that field to union the root's dependency names into each package's before evaluating `n/no-extraneous-import`, so restoring it would silently return the repo to inheriting. pnpm reads `pnpm-workspace.yaml` instead, as do `readyup` and `nmr`, so nothing else depends on it. A missing declaration is reported by `nmr lint:check`, and the fix is to declare the dependency, never to suppress the rule.

A dependency that two or more manifests declare is versioned once, in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `catalog:` block, and each manifest names it as `"catalog:"`. Anything declared by a single manifest keeps a literal version there. `savePrefix: ''` pins exact versions either way.

### Intra-package imports

A package reaches its own source through the subpath import `#src/*`, which maps to `./src/*`. The package declares it in the `imports` field of its `package.json`, which Node, TypeScript, Vite, and ESLint resolve without further configuration. A compiled library declares it in tsconfig `paths` instead, because `nmr-compile` rewrites those to relative specifiers on emit. A package never declares it in both places: TypeScript consults `paths` before `imports`, and a second declaration can drift from the first without any error.

An import of a file under `src/` never climbs with `..`. It is relative when its target is in the importing file's directory or below, and uses `#src/` otherwise. A test file is the one exception: It reaches the directory beside its `__tests__/` with a single `..`. A file outside `src/`, such as `package.json`, is outside the alias's reach and is imported relatively. An aliased specifier keeps its `.ts` extension, as a relative one does, and `import-x/extensions` reports one that omits it.

Every package declares the alias, `_workspace` included, so that a package copied from the scaffold starts with it.

### Git hooks

Lefthook formats staged files with `nmr fmt` in the pre-commit hook, and re-stages what it rewrites. `nmr fmt` is what the hook runs rather than Prettier directly, so the hook and `nmr fmt:check` select the same files: both honor every `.prettierignore` in the tree, where a Prettier invocation from the repo root reads only the root one.

### TypeScript

Uses `tsgo` (TypeScript native preview) for type checking.

The language level and strictness set come from `@williamthorsen/tsconfig`, which the root `tsconfig.json` extends: `@tsconfig/strictest` plus the Node options it omits, at NodeNext/ES2025. The root adds only `resolveJsonModule` and turns off `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`, under which the typecheck rejects the `.ts` extension on a `#src/` specifier; no package here emits with `tsc`, and `nmr-compile` turns the flag on for its own emit. A package declares only what is genuinely its own. Do not restate the base's flags here or in a package config — a second copy is what drifts.

`lib` replaces rather than extends, so a package needing DOM types repeats the ES year alongside them.

## Code style

- Never use `any`, type assertions, or non-null assertions.
